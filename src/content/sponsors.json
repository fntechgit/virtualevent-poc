They have started to transition from static, hardware-based networks to virtualized software and cloud-based applications as a means to accelerate time to market, respond to dynamic capacity and meet customer experience demands while evolving to a 5G core. Many Service Providers start their 5G journey with transforming the EPC for a variety of functions including Mobile Packet Core, IMS, CDN, vRAN. Running Cisco's Mobility solution on top of a unified platform drives down the cost of telco cloud platform integration and streamlines ongoing operational support, reducing customer's Total Cost of Ownership. This includes Cisco's market-leading virtualized packet core built upon Cisco UCS, Virtualized Infrastructure Manager and Nexus fabric.",
