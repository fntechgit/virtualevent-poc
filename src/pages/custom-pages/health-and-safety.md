OCP is working very closely with Team San Jose to incorporate new health and safety features to ensure both attendee and sponsor experiences are safe, comfortable and productive. OCP is committed to creating a secure and supportive environment for our Community to return to in-person meetings, including:

* An expo hall that has been extended to allow for greater separation of booths with wider walkways
* Session rooms to be set to reduced capacity to incorporate distanced seating
* Reusable masks and hand sanitizer bottles distributed at registration
* Extensive cleaning of all surfaces

**COVID-19 Regulations**\
The San José City Council on August 24, 2021 unanimously voted to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for attendees at events of 50 or more people in city-owned buildings at the August 24 City Council Meeting. The requirement doesn’t apply to those under 12 who are not yet eligible for vaccination. A negative COVID-19 test result will not substitute for proof of vaccination. The new rules outlined in the draft ordinance will remain in effect until repealed or when the City terminates its Proclamation of Local Emergency related to COVID-19.



OCP will follow all county, state and federal rules and regulations regarding travel and meetings at the time of the 2021 OCP Global Summit. During the registration process, OCP attendees will be asked to acknowledge and take responsibility for adhering to any and all travel and public participation regulations.

OCP, FNTECH, and Team San Jose are not responsible for any expenses incurred should an attendee be denied entry into the country, state, or event, including but not limited to: airfare, hotel, meals, and event registration fees.
