**Q. What internet browsers do you suggest for your platform?**

A. FNvirtual works best in Chrome, Safari, Brave, and Firefox. To ensure you have a fast, safe, and secure internet experience, please verify your preferred browser is up to date.

**Q. What is an FNid?**

A. Your FNid is a set of credentials that authenticates you as a user of the FNvirtual Event Platform. When you create your FNid, you enter basic info about yourself and create a passcode to protect your info.

**Q. I created my FNid; why do I need to register for the event as well?**

A. Creating an FNid and registering/purchasing an event ticket are two different things.

* Think of your FNid like a virtual ID card. These credentials tell the system you are you and permit access to FNvirtual registered events. (On the day of the event, you will simply log in with your FNid credentials; the system will know if you purchased an event ticket because it will be linked to your FNid.)
* When you register/purchase an event ticket, you are gaining access to the event itself. Just like you would not be permitted entry to an in-person event without your printed badge, you will not be allowed to enter an FNvirtual event without a valid virtual ticket to that specific event. This step must be completed prior to attending each event.
* Please use the same email address for each event and FNid associated with that event.

**Q. Who will see the information in my FNid?**

A. Your basic FNid information (sans your passcode) will become your attendee profile.

* The information you provide in your FNid will be shared with the event host and may be shared with select event sponsors, depending on the event. Please reach out to the event’s management team for more information.
* The chat feature in FNvirtual events only shares your name as you have it in FNid. If you want to connect with someone outside of FNvirtual, you will have to intentionally share your contact information with them.

**Q. What is my speaker information used for?**

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->A. <!--\[endif]-->The information you provide as a speaker/presenter through FNspeaker.mgmt will be visible to attendees. If you are a speaker, you will have two profiles for an event.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->· <!--\[endif]-->**Speaker Profile:** Information specific to your speaking opportunity (your bio, etc.)

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->· <!--\[endif]-->**FNid Attendee Profile:** Only your name is shared through the chat feature. If you opt-in, additional information is shared with sponsors.

**Q. I forgot my FNid login/password**

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->A. <!--\[endif]-->Please visit *https://idp.fntech.com*.

Select “Log in” and choose “Forgot Password?”. Follow the process to receive your password.

You will receive an email—at whatever email address you used to create your FNid—which will allow you to reset your password.

**Q. I’m having trouble with my FNid. Who should I contact?**

A. For tech support, please email [support@fntech.com](mailto:support@fntech.com)

**Q. I’m having trouble registering for an event. Who should I contact?**

A. For FNregistration support, please email [registration@fntech.com](mailto:registration@fntech.com)

**Q. I know the event url, but can’t find my ticket. How can I enter the event?**

A. If you registered with your FNid, you can simply log in using those credentials. The system will know that you purchased a ticket.

**Q. The event page says, “I’m sorry, you are not registered for the event,” but I have an FNid. Why am I unable to enter the event?**

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->A. <!--\[endif]-->Each FNvirtual event requires that you are registered and/or have purchased a virtual ticket to that event. The website should redirect you to Registration so you can purchase a ticket.

Be sure to log in to your FNid for a faster registration process.

Once you finish the registration process, you will be able to enter the event with your FNid credentials.

**Q. The event webpage isn’t loading for me. What should I do?**

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->A. <!--\[endif]-->First, log out of the website and log back in using your FNid.

Next, you may need to clear your cache. Websites often ‘cache’ information so they load faster the next time you visit. This can occasionally cause issues, like a ‘white screen’ or error code.

If you are still having trouble, please email your issue to [support@fntech.com](mailto:support@fntech.com) and include the internet browser and version number you are using.

**Q. How do I increase or decrease the text in FNvirtual Event Platform?**

A. Open your internet browser. Then…

* **Keystrokes for Mac users: “**Command” + “+/-"
* **Keystrokes for PC users:** “Alt + View”, then point to the text size you desire (Largest, Larger, Medium (default), Smaller and Smallest)

**Q. I’m interested in using FNvirtual for an event. Who should I contact?**

A. Please email [govirtual@fntech.com](mailto:govirtual@fntech.com). We’d love to collaborate with you!
