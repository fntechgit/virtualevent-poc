They have started to transition from static, hardware-based networks to virtualized software and cloud-based applications as a means to accelerate time to market, respond to dynamic capacity and meet customer experience demands while evolving to a 5G core. Many Service Providers start their 5G journey with transforming the EPC for a variety of functions including Mobile Packet Core, IMS, CDN, vRAN. Running Cisco's Mobility solution on top of a unified platform drives down the cost of telco cloud platform integration and streamlines ongoing operational support, reducing customer's Total Cost of Ownership. This includes Cisco's market-leading virtualized packet core built upon Cisco UCS, Virtualized Infrastructure Manager and Nexus fabric.       \n\n**Connect LIVE with our Cisco team during the following hours; October 19 to October 21 from 6:00am to 12:0pm PT.

          "intro": "\\\nBacked by over 60 founding members and a global community of over 105,000 individual contributors, the Open Infrastructure Foundation (OIF) is the successor to the OpenStack Foundation. From cloud hosting to the driving force behind 5G, these projects are code first and operate under the guiding principles called the “Four Opens.” These projects include [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [Airship](https://airshipit.org/), [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/), [OpenInfra Labs](https://openinfralabs.org/), [StarlingX](https://starlingx.io/), and [Zuul](https://zuul-ci.org/).\n\nAfter 10 years, OpenStack is one of the Top 3 most actively developed open source software projects, along with the Linux kernel and Chromium. The OIF supports open source communities with a focus on building software that runs in production across the world and addressing numerous emerging use cases, including AI/ML; CI/CD; container infrastructure; edge computing; and public, private and hybrid clouds. The OIF also nurtures cross-community collaboration with other open source communities like Ansible, Ceph, Gerrit, Kubernetes, Magma rust-vmm and more.\n\nThe OIF invites you to join and participate in the open infrastructure community—everyone is welcome.
