### **COVID-19 REGULATIONS**

Per the mandates set forth by the San José City Council, please review the following event requirements that will apply to all in-person attendees of the 2021 OCP Global Summit:

* All attendees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to enter the convention center and participate in the event.
* To be considered fully vaccinated and therefore admitted into the event, the final dose of vaccination must be completed no later than October 25, two weeks prior to the Summit start date.
* The city of San Jose accepts all vaccines approved by the [WHO](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/agency/who/).
* A negative COVID-19 test result will not substitute for proof of vaccination.
* Exemptions for medical or religious reasons are allowed. Paperwork must be provided as well as proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours of entry to the event.
* Masks are required to be worn indoors at all times while at the event, unless you are speaking on stage, eating or drinking

**PROCESS FOR VACCINE VERIFICATION** 

OCP and the SJCC are partnering with 42Chat to give attendees an opportunity to upload their proof of vaccination for pre-verification and expedited entry into the SJCC. The 42Chat tool will allow attendees to securely upload their proof of vaccination in return for a “fast pass” that may be shown upon entry to the SJCC.  Please ensure you have the correct mobile number associated with your profile/event ticket. If you are managing a group order, please be sure to update mobile numbers for all assigned tickets.

* Valid forms for proof of vaccination include one of the following:
* CDC vaccination card or similar documentation issued by another foreign governmental jurisdiction
* Photo of a vaccination card (physical or stored on a phone or electronic device)
* Healthcare Provider documentation of vaccination
* Personal digital COVID-19 vaccine record with a QR code that scans to display name, date of birth, vaccine dates and vaccine type

**Attendees coming from North America:** 

1. Attendees will be contacted at the end of October via text message asking you to upload your document(s) for verification. 
2. Once uploaded, 42Chat will verify your document.
3. If verified, you will receive a response with a green checkmark. Use this screen to expedite your entrance into the Global Summit.
4. We encourage you to utilize this pre-verification process so that you can access the “fast pass” lanes at OCP Registration. Onsite verification lanes could delay your entry.

**International Attendees coming from outside North America:**  

1. For those international travelers who won’t be able to utilize our text feature, OCP will email you a link at the end of October to upload your vaccination documentation.
2. Once uploaded, 42Chat will verify your document.
3. If verified, you will receive a response with a green checkmark. Use this screen to expedite your entrance into the Global Summit.

**OCP CARES**

OCP is working very closely with Team San Jose to incorporate new health and safety features to ensure both attendee and sponsor experiences are safe, comfortable and productive. OCP is committed to creating a secure and supportive environment for our Community to return to in-person meetings, including:

* Session rooms to be set to reduced capacity to incorporate distanced seating
* Masks and hand sanitizer bottles distributed at registration
* Extensive cleaning of all surfaces

OCP will follow all county, state and federal rules and regulations regarding travel and meetings at the time of the 2021 OCP Global Summit.
