YOU DECIDE!

In the FNvirtual platform, the top navigation is up to you! The “About this event” section could be a great way to share the story behind your meeting. How did it come to be? What were the driving forces or key turning points? Maybe include a timeline, or some big highlights that happened throughout the years. Would you rather use this real estate for something else? No problem! Just name the tab something else and point it in a totally different direction!
