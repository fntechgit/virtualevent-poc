**\*PLEASE NOTE\*** It will take 24-48 hrs for your documents to be reviewed/validated.  If you submit your documentation without enough time for it to be validated and sent back to you, you will need to bring proof of vaccination onsite and use the “onsite verification lanes” to enter the San Jose Convention Center.

After validation, you may view your green checkmark anytime by texting “STATUS” to **866.468.1126.**

**PROCESS FOR VACCINE VERIFICATION** 

OCP and the SJCC are partnering with 42Chat to give attendees an opportunity to upload their proof of vaccination for pre-verification and expedited entry into the SJCC. The 42Chat tool will allow attendees to securely upload their proof of vaccination in return for a “fast pass” that may be shown upon entry to the SJCC.  Please ensure you have the correct mobile number associated with your profile/event ticket. If you are managing a group order, please be sure to update mobile numbers for all assigned tickets.

**Valid forms for proof of vaccination include one of the following:**

* CDC vaccination card or similar documentation issued by another foreign governmental jurisdiction
* Photo of a vaccination card (physical or stored on a phone or electronic device)
* Healthcare Provider documentation of vaccination
* Personal digital COVID-19 vaccine record with a QR code that scans to display name, date of birth, vaccine dates and vaccine type

**Attendees coming from North America:** 

1. Attendees will be contacted on the following dates via text message asking you to upload your document(s) for verification: Oct 25, Nov 2, Nov 7. *(If you did not receive the text or would like to start the process yourself, please text "Hi" to 866-468-1126 and follow the prompts.)*
