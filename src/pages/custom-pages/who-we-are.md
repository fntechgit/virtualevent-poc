•  FNTECH was founded in 1998 in Huntington Beach, California.

•  Over the past 20+ years, we’ve successfully partnered with top-tier companies like Apple, Facebook, Hewlett Packard, Taco Bell, Wells Fargo, Vans, and Volcom.

•  We’ve worked on events of all sizes, types and budgets, both domestically and abroad. In-person, virtual, and everything in-between. 

•  We have two large headquarters – one in South San Francisco and another in Southern California, which includes a virtual reality lab, 3D printing hub, and robust wood/metal fabrication shop.
