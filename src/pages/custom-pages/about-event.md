**THANK YOU for joining us for OCP TECH WEEK! The on-demand content from all sessions will be available by the end of next week.** (posted 11/13)

**We would like to thank all our sponsors, volunteer leaders, and OCP Community for making this event such a success.**



**ABOUT OCP TECH WEEK**

OCP TECH WEEK was four days packed with Engineering Workshops held during various time zones to allow for global participation. These were not typical lecture presentations, but live sessions - allowing plenty of time for interactive collaboration! Given the great momentum and response from our Virtual Summit in May, OCP provided this virtual forum to share the following:

* A look back at our 2019/2020 Key Accomplishments and Strategic Actions
* A sneak peak at our 2021 Technology Initiatives (from our Communityâ€™s perspective) and how OCP will address these future trends
* Announcements on new Contributions Requirements and changes to Recognition Programs for Facilities/Products
* Technical deep dives packed with interactive discussions on OCP Project activity
