During the August 2020 All Hands meeting, you’ll hear new announcements, learn from FNTECH’s leadership team, celebrate a few exciting milestones, and be able to ask questions in an open forum. 

In an effort to drive transparency and align all three FNTECH locations, we’re lifting the hood, as it were, so you’ll know exactly where things stand with the company today and what’s on the horizon.
