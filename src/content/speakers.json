Managing events in scores of locations around the world, she has overseen a wide array of types and sizes of events: conferences, summits, tradeshows, launch events, sponsorships, roadshows, corporate parties and meetings. No stranger to complex budgeting, Kelley has been charged with managing event budgets upwards of $12 million. Kelley’s team of highly skilled event managers are second to none, and with them, she regularly orchestrates the meticulous planning process encompassing everything from the moment a venue needs to be sourced to the very last invoice is paid. Kelley has a business degree from California Polytechnic, San Luis Obispo, with a concentration in Marketing. Since orange is Kelley’s daughter’s favorite color, she frequently uses a bright orange pen instead of red when reviewing documents because it’s “nicer.” </p>","irc":"","twitter":"","org_has_cloud":false,"country":"","available_for_bureau":false,"funded_travel":false,"willing_to_travel":false,"willing_to_present_video":false,"email":"kel%2A%2A%2A%40fntech.com","member_id":50263,"registration_request_id":0,"pic":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/profile-images/KSchmidt-square1.jpg","big_pic":"https://object-storage.public.mtl1.vexxhost.net/swift/v1/6e4619c416ff4bd19e1c087f27a43eea/assets-fn/profile-images/DSC031341.jpeg","company":null,"phone_number":null,"featured":false,"presentations":[2378],"moderated_presentations":[],"gender":null,"member_external_id":23751,"badge_features":[],"affiliations":[],"languages":[],"other_presentation_links":[],"areas_of_expertise":[],"travel_preferences":[],"active_involvements":[],"organizational_roles":[]}]
