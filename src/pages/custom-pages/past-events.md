In May of 2020, OCP held its first ever all-virtual event, the 2020 OCP Virtual Summit and Future Technologies Symposium. [Click here](https://www.opencompute.org/blog/2020-ocp-virtual-summit-by-the-numbers "2020 OCP Virtual Summit and Future Technologies Symposium report") to review the post-event data report.

We are blown away by the turnout and the commitment of our Sponsors and the entire OCP Community. Thank you for making this event so special. Despite not being able to meet face to face, it was a hit!

The Virtual Summit - including all the sponsor booths and session content - will remain accessible through March 2021. Use the links below to check out the virtual environment.
