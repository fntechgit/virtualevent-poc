We have built fun new ways for you to let your community know you are using Stars!

**1. Stars Launch Post:** If you are new to Stars, you can post a launch video to let your community know you are now using Stars. If you onboarded after June 15, 2022 you can use this post to participate in the <a href="https://starsfest2022.fnvirtual.app/creator-competition" target="_blank">creator competition</a> by including #StarsEverywhere. Follow these steps to post, available only on New Page Experience:
