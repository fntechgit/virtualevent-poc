### REGISTRATION AND LOGIN PROCESS  

<br>

**Q. What is an FNid?** 

A. Your FNid is a set of credentials that authenticates you as a user of the FNvirtual Event Platform. When you create your FNid, you enter basic info about yourself and create a password to protect your info. You will use your FNid to access all FNvirtual Events. 

<br>

**Q. I created my FNid; why do I need to register for the event as well?**

A. Creating an FNid and registering/purchasing an event ticket are two different things. 

* Think of your FNid like a virtual ID card. These credentials tell the system you are you and permit access to FNvirtual registered events. (On the day of the event, you will simply log in with your FNid credentials; the system will know if you purchased an event ticket because it will be linked to your FNid.)
* When you register/purchase an event ticket, you are gaining access to the event itself. Just like you would not be permitted entry to an in-person event without your printed badge, you will not be allowed to enter an FNvirtual event without a valid virtual ticket to that specific event. This step must be completed prior to attending each event. 
* Please use the same email address for each event by signing into your FNid account during the registration process. 

<br>

**Q.  What is a single-use login code?** 

A. This is an alternative option which allows attendees to use a single-use login code to access the event, rather than logging in with a passcode or social media login. 

* When you choose this option, we will email you a single-use login code. You must use the same email address you provided when you registered for the event in order to receive the code. (This is frequently a business email address.) 

  * You will receive an email with the subject line: “Your Verification Code” 
  * Act quickly; the code will only be valid for 2 minutes
  * Each time you use this login option, you must request a new verification code

<br>

**Q.  Why am I being asked to allow the Virtual Event app to access my information after I log in for the first time?**  

A. In accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines, the website is providing details on how it may use your information. This is standard industry practice. You will only need to accept this set of permissions once. 

<br>

**Q. Can I log into an event without an FNid?** 

A. You may use a single-use login code or one of the social media authorizations (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Apple) to enter the event. IMPORTANT: Please be sure to use the SAME EMAIL that you used to register for the event! If you use a social authorization, be sure the platform has the same email you used to register for the event! 

<br>

**Q. I forgot my FNid login/password**

A. Please visit <a href=https://idp.fntech.com target="_blank">https://idp.fntech.com</a>.

* Choose “Forgot Password?”. Follow the process to receive your password.   
* You will receive an email—at whatever email address you used to create your FNid—which will allow you to reset your password.

**Where can I find this?**

<br>

**Q.  The event page says, “I’m sorry, you are not registered for the event,” but I have an FNid. Why am I unable to enter the event?** 

A. Each FNvirtual event requires a separate registration/ticket for that specific event. The event website will redirect you to event registration so you can purchase this ticket. 

* You will be asked log in using your FNid or a social authorization (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.). You may also request to have a single-use authorization code emailed to you. IMPORTANT: Be sure to use the same email address that you provided when you registered for the event.
* Once you finish registering (purchasing your ticket), you will be able to enter the event with your FNid credentials, social authorization, or single-use login code.

**Q. It appears that some information is not showing correctly on my page. How can I fix this?** 

A. FNvirtual uses dynamic data which adjusts in size and position on the page depending on the size/shape of viewable space. Try adjusting your window size by hovering over the edge or corner of the window and dragging your mouse to the desired position. This should adjust the image and/or text accordingly. 

<br>

**Q. How do I increase or decrease the text in FNvirtual Event Platform?** 

A. Open your internet browser. Then…

* Keystrokes for Mac users: “Command” + “+/-”

<br>

* To find a specific attendee for a 1:1 conversation, type their name in the search box. Clicking on their name will cause a new pop-up chat window to appear. If they have allowed this feature, you may also email the attendee.
* In the Public Conversation chat box, your comments and any replies to your comments will be seen by all attendees. 

<br>

**Q. Can I have multiple sessions open at the same time? Will it kick me out of my original session if I join another session?**

* The system is designed for you to watch one session at a time. 
* If you want to join two or more sessions, you will need to open a new browser window.    

<br>

**Q. Why is there a time zone in the schedule? How do I know what time zone the show is happening?** 

A. Even though the event is virtual, the event does need to exist in a specific time zone. The time zone is listed in the website header and if the event is hybrid (both in-person and virtual), it will be the same time zone as the in-person event location. 

<br>
