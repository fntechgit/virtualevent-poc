The initiative was launched at the OCP Global and Regional (European) Summits last year, and they were among the most popular attractions. Not only do the partners get a chance to showcase their OCP Accepted™ and OCP Inspired™ product offerings, they also get a chance to receive feedback from Summit attendees. The OCP Experience Center offers Summit attendees a chance to explore products and their piece-parts, and see through the software solutions that have been built primarily for the platforms being demonstrated.\n\n**To explore all each Experience Center's content, in the right column, click the center you want to learn more about!**\n\n**[Hardware Management Center](/a/sponsor/85-hardware-management)**\n\n**[Open System Firmware](/a/sponsor/86-open-system-firmware)**\n\n**[Tap Center ](/a/sponsor/87-tap)**\n\n**[Networking Center ](/a/sponsor/89-networking)** \n\n**[Telco Center](/a/sponsor/90-telco)**\n\n**[Server Center ](/a/sponsor/91-server)**\n\n**[OAI Center](/a/sponsor/92-oai)**\n\n**[Test and Validation Center ](/a/sponsor/93-test-and-validation)**\n\n**[Storage Experience Center](/a/sponsor/94-storage)**",
