**Q. How do I add my photo or update the information to my profile?**

A. Visit <https://idp.fntech.com> and log in to your FNid profile.

* The information you provide in your FNid will be shared with the event host and may be shared with select event sponsors, depending on the event’s opt-in policy. Please reach out to the event’s management team for more information.
* The chat feature in FNvirtual events only shares your name (as you have entered it in FNid). If you would like to connect with someone outside of the FNvirtual platform, you will need to intentionally share your contact information with them.

**Q. How do I increase or decrease the text in FNvirtual Event Platform?**

A. FNvirtual uses dynamic data which adjusts in size and position on the page depending on the size/shape of viewable space. Try adjusting your window size by hovering over the edge or corner of the window and dragging your mouse to the desired position. This should adjust the image and/or text accordingly.

**Q. One or more pieces of the event page aren’t loading for me. What should I do?**

A. First log out of the website and log back in with your FNid.

* Next, you may need to clear out your cache. Websites often ‘cache’ information so they load faster the next time you visit. This can cause a ‘white screen’.
* Disable third party cookie blockers, privacy shields, and/or ad blocking plugins
* If you are still having trouble, please email [support@fntech.com](<>) and provide the following info: (1) the browser and browser version you are using, (2) what page you’re having trouble with, and (3) the event you are trying to access.
