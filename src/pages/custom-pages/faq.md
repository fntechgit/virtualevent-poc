---
**Q. What internet browsers do you suggest for your platform?**

A. FNvirtual works best in Chrome, Safari, Brave, and Firefox. To ensure you have a fast, safe, and secure internet experience, please verify your preferred browser is up to date.

**Q. What is an FNid?**

A. Your FNid is a set of credentials that authenticates you as a user of the FNvirtual Event Platform. When you create your FNid, you enter basic info about yourself and create a password to protect your info. You will use your FNid to access all FNvirtual Events.

**Q. I created my FNid; why do I need to register for the event as well?**

A. Creating an FNid and registering/purchasing an event ticket are two different things.

* Think of your FNid like a virtual ID card. These credentials tell the system you are you and permit access to FNvirtual registered events. (On the day of the event, you will simply log in with your FNid credentials; the system will know if you purchased an event ticket because it will be linked to your FNid.)
* When you register/purchase an event ticket, you are gaining access to the event itself. Just like you would not be permitted entry to an in-person event without your printed badge, you will not be allowed to enter an FNvirtual event without a valid virtual ticket to that specific event. This step must be completed prior to attending each event.
* Please use the same email address for each event by signing into your FNid account during the registration process.

**Q. Why am I being asked to allow the Virtual Event app to access my information after I log in for the first time?**

A. In accordance with General Data Protection Regulation guidelines, the website is providing details on how it may use your information. This is standard industry practice. You will only need to accept this set of permissions once.

**Q. Who will see the information in my FNid?**

A. Your basic FNid information will become your attendee profile.

* The information you provide in your FNid will be shared with the event host and may be shared with select event sponsors, depending on the event’s opt-in policy. Please reach out to the event’s management team for more information.
* The chat feature in FNvirtual events only shares your name as you have it in FNid. If you want to connect with someone outside of FNvirtual, you will have to intentionally share your contact information with them.

**Q. What is my speaker information used for?**

A. The information you provide as a speaker/presenter through FNspeaker.mgmt will be visible to attendees. If you are a speaker, you will have two profiles for an event.

* Speaker Profile: Information specific to your speaking opportunity (your bio, etc.)
* FNid Attendee Profile: Only your name is shared through the chat feature. If you opt-in, additional information is shared with sponsors.

**Q. I forgot my FNid login/password**

A. Please visit https://idp.fntech.com.

* Choose “Forgot Password?”. Follow the process to receive your password.
* You will receive an email—at whatever email address you used to create your FNid—which will allow you to reset your password.

**Q. I’m having trouble with my FNid. Who should I contact?**

A. For tech support, please email [support@fntech.com](<>)

**Q. I’m having trouble registering for an event. Who should I contact?**

A. For FNregistration support, please email [registration@fntech.com](<>)

**Q. I’m looking for my virtual “ticket” to an event. Where can I find this?**

A. After you registered/purchased your ticket, you should have received an Order Confirmation email that contained your virtual ticket.

* If you don’t remember receiving your Order Confirmation email, please check your Junk/Spam folder for an email from registration@fntech.com
* Alternatively, you can find your ticket in the “My Tickets” page in FNregistration. You may use your FNid to log in here <https://registration.fntech.com/a/member/orders>
* For additional FNregistration support, please email [registration@fntech.com](<>)

**Q. I know the event url, but can’t find my ticket. How can I enter the event?**

A. If you registered with your FNid, you can simply log in using those credentials. The system will know that you purchased a ticket.

**Q. I’m looking for my event order. Where can I find this?**

1. You can access your order from the Order Confirmation email you received at the address you provided during the registration process.

* If you don’t remember receiving your Order Confirmation email, please check your Junk folder for an email from registration@fntech.com
* Alternatively, you can find your ticket in the “My Tickets” page in FNregistration. You may use your FNid to log in here <https://registration.fntech.com/a/member/orders>
* For additional FNregistration support, please email [registration@fntech.com](<>)

**Q. The event page says, “I’m sorry, you are not registered for the event,” but I have an FNid. Why am I unable to enter the event?**

A. Each FNvirtual event requires that you are registered and/or have purchased a virtual ticket to that event. The website will redirect you to Registration so you can purchase a ticket.

* Be sure to log in to your FNid for a faster registration process.
* Once you finish the registering, you will be able to enter the event with your FNid credentials. You will need to return to the event URL to enter.

**Q. The event webpage isn’t loading for me. What should I do?**

A. First, log out of the website and log back in using your FNid.

* Next, you may need to clear your cache. Websites often ‘cache’ information so they load faster the next time you visit. This can occasionally cause issues, like a ‘white screen’ or an error code.
* If you are still having trouble, please email [support@fntech.com](<>) and tell us what browser & version you are using, what page you’re having trouble with -- including the event you are trying to access..

**Q. How do I increase or decrease the text in FNvirtual Event Platform?**

A. Open your internet browser. Then…

* Keystrokes for Mac users: “Command” + “+/-”
* Keystrokes for PC users: “Alt + View”, then point to the text size you desire (Largest, Larger, Medium (default), Smaller and Smallest)

**Q. I’m interested in using FNvirtual for an event. Who should I contact?**

A. Please email [govirtual@fntech.com](<>). We’d love to collaborate with you!
