title: ABOUT INFINITY FESTIVAL
---
The Infinity Festival, guided by more than 150 Advisors from the leading studios, talent agencies and technology companies, celebrates “Story Enabled by Technology” by bringing together Silicon Valley innovators with Hollywood’s leading storytellers. IF Programming has an emerging-technology focus, and includes high-profile screenings, tech exhibitions, thought-leading speakers, panel discussions, innovation labs, VIP networking opportunities and a fine art exhibition. The festival is inspired by the seemingly infinite possibilities being realized in content creation for evolving technologies and platforms.

The Festival is free this year and attendees can register by clicking the Infinity Festival Logo in the top left corner of this website. For additional information, please visit [infinityfestival.com. ](http://infinityfestival.com/)
