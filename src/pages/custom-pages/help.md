### Having trouble logging in?

First, make sure you have an [OpenStackID](https://openstackid.org/).

* **I have registered for the event. Why do I need an OpenStackID as well?**\
  Your [OpenStackID](https://openstackid.org/) credential allows you access to the virtual event. This is similar to showing your ID for an in-person event. It’s how we know you are you!
* **I have an OpenStackID, but I forgot my password. What do I do?**\
  You can reset your OpenStackID password by clicking “forgot password” here: <https://openstackid.org/>
